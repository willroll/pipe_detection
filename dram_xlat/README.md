# dram_xlat — Automated DRAM Address-Translation Discovery

A toolkit that reverse-engineers the *undocumented* physical-address → DRAM-coordinate
translation a memory controller uses, purely from software, via **row-buffer conflict
timing** as a side channel.

The goal is to recover the GF(2) (XOR) functions the Unified Memory Controller (UMC)
applies to map a physical address to `(Channel, Rank, Bank Group, Bank, Row, Column)`.
Once recovered, those functions predict, for any two physical addresses, whether they
collide in the same bank — the foundational primitive for open hardware analysis,
memory-performance characterization, DRAM-topology diagnostics, and defensive
(Rowhammer-mitigation) research.

This is a *measurement / characterization* tool. It observes access latency; it does
not hammer memory, flip bits, or exploit anything. The method is the published
technique from **Pessl, Gruss, Maurice, Schwarz, Mangard — "DRAMA: Exploiting DRAM
Addressing for Cross-CPU Attacks", USENIX Security 2016**, generalized here to a
noise-tolerant solver.

> ### Scope & responsible use
> DRAM addressing functions are hardware facts about the machine you run this on. The
> toolkit only *reads* local timing; it needs no special target and moves no data
> off-box. Run it on hardware you own or are authorized to characterize. The optional
> MSR prefetcher-control path writes a model-specific register and is **off by
> default** — read `scripts/prepare_target.sh` before enabling it.

## Architecture

The pipeline mirrors the four phases of the execution plan:

```
   Phase 1 + 2   probe/ (C)      bare-metal timing harness: rdtscp + fences +
   acquisition                   clflush, hugepage-backed contiguous memory, core
                                 pinning. Emits CSV:  addr_a,addr_b,latency_cycles
                                        │
   Phase 2       orchestrator/sweep.py  drives the probe over strided pair sweeps,
   orchestration                 aggregates millions of pairs into one dataset.
                                        │
   Phase 3       solver/ (Python)       classify latency → conflict/hit, recover XOR
   discovery                     functions via GF(2) null-space + genetic search,
                                 cross-check with Z3. Emits a basis of functions.
                                        │
   Phase 4       verify/verify.py       synthesize addresses that MUST collide under
   verification                  the model, measure them, report the hit rate.
```

### Why it works (one paragraph)

Two physical addresses that map to the **same bank but different rows** force the
controller to close one row and open another on every alternating access — a
*row-buffer conflict* — measurably slower than two addresses in different banks
(served in parallel). "Same bank" means every bank-selecting XOR function agrees on
both addresses. Writing that agreement as `parity(m · a) == parity(m · b)`, i.e.
`m · (a ⊕ b) == 0`, turns the problem into linear algebra over GF(2): the
bank-selecting functions are exactly the **null space** of the matrix of difference
vectors `a ⊕ b` over all *conflict* (slow) pairs. Timing noise mislabels some pairs,
so the exact null-space solver is backed by a genetic search tolerant of a
configurable error rate.

## Quick start

```sh
# 0. prepare the target (once, as root): reserve hugepages, print isolation guidance
sudo scripts/prepare_target.sh

# 1. build the probe
cd probe && make            # or: cmake -B build && cmake --build build

# 2. acquire a dataset on the Zen target
sudo ./probe/dram_probe pairs --hugepage 1G --reps 64 --num-pairs 2000000 > dataset.csv
#    (or let the orchestrator manage the sweeps:)
#    python3 orchestrator/sweep.py --probe ./probe/dram_probe --out dataset.csv

# 3. discover the functions (anywhere)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 solver/solve.py dataset.csv --out functions.json

# 4. verify against the hardware
python3 verify/verify.py functions.json --probe ./probe/dram_probe --hugepage 1G
```

### Dashboard

`docs/index.html` is a self-contained page (no build step, no network) that
visualizes a full solver run — the bimodal latency distribution, which address
bits select the row, the recovered XOR translation map, and how each solver
route holds up as the timing modes get harder to separate. Open it directly in
a browser, or serve `docs/` with GitHub Pages. Every figure is real output from
the synthetic self-test.

### Validate the analysis without hardware

The solver is fully testable on any machine — it recovers a *known* DRAM function from
a noisy synthetic truth table:

```sh
make test        # or: python3 solver/selftest.py
```

---

## Iterative workflow

Per the execution plan this runs as a loop: build & run Phase 1 on the target, feed
the latency logs back, refine the timing loop or solver parameters from the empirical
distribution. The probe prints a latency **histogram summary** to stderr on every run
so you can confirm the bimodal hit/conflict separation before trusting the solver; if
the two modes are not cleanly separated, increase `--reps`, pin to an isolated core,
and disable prefetchers (see `scripts/prepare_target.sh`).

## Targets: Intel vs AMD

The probe is x86-64 generic (`rdtscp` + `mfence`/`lfence` + `clflush`); the solver and
verifier are architecture-agnostic (they consume the CSV). The only vendor-specific
piece is prefetcher control, which is hardcoded for Intel and env-overridable for AMD.

### Intel (incl. Xeon E5-1650 v4, Broadwell-EP) — the better-supported path

- **Prefetcher disable works natively.** `--disable-prefetch` writes `MSR 0x1A4`
  (MISC_FEATURE_CONTROL), bits `[3:0]` = L2 stream, L2 adjacent-line, L1 DCU, and
  DCU-IP prefetchers. Correct for Nehalem through at least Skylake/Broadwell.
- **No `clflushopt` on Broadwell** (Skylake+ only) — `timing.h` `#ifdef`-guards it and
  falls back to `clflush`, so it just works. Build on the box with `-march=native`, or
  cross-build with `make CFLAGS="-O2 -march=broadwell"`.
- **Invariant TSC** (`constant_tsc`/`nonstop_tsc`): `rdtscp` counts are stable across
  frequency changes; still fix the frequency (disable Turbo) for a clean split.
- **Quad-channel → you also recover a *channel* hash.** Intel interleaves channels with
  an XOR of several physical bits; the solver returns it as extra functions in the
  basis. What you recover depends on how many DIMMs/channels you populate and the BIOS
  interleave settings. Single socket (E5-1650 v4) keeps it to one controller's map.
- **Use 1 GiB hugepages, reserved at boot.** Runtime 1 GiB reservation usually fails
  from fragmentation, so add to the kernel cmdline and reboot:
  `default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8`. (2 MiB only covers bits 0–20 — too
  low for channel/rank bits.)
- **Ground truth exists:** DRAMA's published Intel results are from this Core/Xeon-E5
  era, so you can sanity-check the recovered functions.

Recommended run on an E5-1650 v4:

```sh
cd probe && make                               # -march=native → broadwell, clflush fallback
sudo ../scripts/prepare_target.sh              # reserve hugepages, print isolation steps
sudo ./dram_probe pairs --hugepage 1G --reps 64 --num-pairs 2000000 \
     --cpu 3 --rt --disable-prefetch > dataset.csv
python3 ../solver/solve.py dataset.csv --out functions.json
python3 ../verify/verify.py functions.json --probe ./dram_probe --hugepage 1G
```

Not in scope: Intel's LLC **cache-slice** hash is a *different* undocumented function
(cache, not DRAM banks) — same timing-methodology family, but this tool targets DRAM.

### AMD (Zen 17h+)

Same flow, except prefetcher control is model-specific. Disable prefetchers in firmware,
or pass the register from your model's PPR:
`DRAM_PREFETCH_MSR=0x... DRAM_PREFETCH_MASK=0x... ./dram_probe ... --disable-prefetch`.
Disable Core Performance Boost in firmware (no `intel_pstate/no_turbo` knob).
